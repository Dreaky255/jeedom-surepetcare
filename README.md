# Jeedom plugin for Sure Petcare connected products for pets.

<img src="plugin_info/surepetcare_icon.png" align="right">

This is a plugin for the Jeedom (https://www.jeedom.com) open source (https://github.com/jeedom) domotic system.

It will permit to control the Sure Petcare connected products for pets from your Jeedom.

Initially it will only be tested with cat flaps (Pet Porte Connect and soon to be relased Microchip Cat Flap Connect) as there are the only Sure Petcare products currently available.
But when new products are added I will try to upgrade the plugin to support them. I know that a connected feeder is planned.

BIG WARNING : This is a work in progress and not finished. I just committed it to Github to keep a state of my project do not use until further notice. You have been warned.
