# Jeedom plugin for Sure Petcare connected products for pets.

<img src="plugin_info/surepetcare_icon.png" align="right">

This is a plugin for the Jeedom (https://www.jeedom.com) open source (https://github.com/jeedom) home automation system.

It will permit to control the Sure Petcare connected products for pets from your Jeedom.

Initially it has only be tested with cat flaps (Pet Porte Connect and recently released Microchip Cat Flap Connect) as there are the only Sure Petcare connected products that I have.

But when new connected products are added I will try to upgrade the plugin to support them. A connected feeder was recently released, but as I don't own it it is currently not supported by the plugin. I hope to be able to support it in a near future.

This is currently a beta release. The most up-to-date version is in the beta branch.

If you find a bug or want to suggest a new feature, please open an issue.
