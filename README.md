# Jeedom plugin for Sure Petcare connected products for pets.

<img src="plugin_info/surepetcare_icon.png" align="right">

This is a plugin for the Jeedom (https://www.jeedom.com) open source (https://github.com/jeedom) domotic system.

It will permit to control the Sure Petcare connected products for pets from your Jeedom.

Initially it will only e tested with cat flaps as this is the only Sure Petcare product currently released.
But when new products are added I will try to upgrade the plugin to support them. I know that a connected feeder is planned.

BIG WARNING : This is a work in progress and not finished. I just committed it to Github to keep a state of my project do not use until further notice. You have been warned.
